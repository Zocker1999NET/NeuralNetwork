## Target platforms

This library is written in C# and for Windows Universal 10.0 with .NET Framework 4.6 or higher.
So this library runs on all Windows 10 devices, no matter, whether they are PCs, tablets, phones or any other kind of device which is compatible to Windows 10.

Maybe you can also use this libary with Mono, but without any warranty. Explicit ports to other plattforms are, but only if required, welcome.

For the development of this library, I have used Visual Studio 2017 (previously 2015) Community Edition by Microsoft Cooperation.
